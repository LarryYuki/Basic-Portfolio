                <p class="card-text">I'm a full stack web development student in UC Berkeley. I have a B.S degree in
                    Business
                    Marketing from SFSU. As an Apple employee, I truely believe that innovation with technology can
                    change
                    people lives in many ways.
                    I want to implement my ideas to enrich lives on the internet by building a platform with technology
                    I'm
                    learning in university. I want to
                    create something unique and at the same time can benefit majority of people daily.
                    For my free time I like to cook for my family and friends. I love to recreate dishes I like to eat
                    from
                    restaurants. I believe that
                    good food can bring people together with joyfulness. I also love animals especially cats. They are
                    independence, smart, warm and playful.
                    I love to cook for my cats sometimes so that they can love me more.
